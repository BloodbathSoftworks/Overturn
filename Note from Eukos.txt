During my time on the Overturn team we certainly had a ton of fun experimenting with a lot of crazy (and gory) ideas. The atmosphere was laid back 
and we just kept on adding upon the craziness with no end in sight (which in retrospect didn't help the project), but at least we all had a blast 
in the beginning.
